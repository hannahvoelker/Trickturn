# Status report 3
Accomplished this week:
- more sophistication on the front end (currently working on scrolling/mobile)
- Mostly working tilemaps/car sprites before proceeding to questions 
- The beginnnings of an API endpoint that will trigger info to a db at the end of a game
- Emailed professors about using their pictures

Challenges we've faced:
- There are some slight scrolling issues on the front end
- We are all really busy, so not as much got done. However, things are opening up in the coming weeks for some of us which means more will get done. 

Goals for next week:
- Finalize the car sprites/ add an event trigger to allow the student to cross the street
- Add professors asking questions
- Once the game win/lose condition is produced, add the code to trigger insertion into the database/showing of high scores.

* "Set up other sprites & check for collisions with those sprites" => ah, one of my favorite topics in Game Dev.  Bounding box is the way to go.  Have you seen this? https://developer.amazon.com/blogs/post/Tx3AT4I2ENBOI6R/Intro-to-Phaser-Part-3:-Obstacles,-Collision,-Score,-Sound-and-Publishing
