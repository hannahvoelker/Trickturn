# Status Report as of April 7th

## Challenges and issues we faced
    
As of right now, we believe the biggest challenge in the forseeable future would be integrating Phaser with our database of high scores. However, we are confident that this is possible. 

Another issue we need to start consider is drafting what questions our professors will ask.

## Goals for next week
    
Outline our game board layout and build a navigable player.
