# Status Report as of April 7th


## Accomplishments thus far

In addition to last week's accomplishments...

1. Animated player sprite
2. Stitched HTML/JS frontend into nodejs app
3. Added initial end-game behavior: timer, endGame function, etc
4. Created, but not yet integrated, a tilemap for the game board

## Challenges and issues we faced

We had a bit of an issue integrating the original phaser-index file into the node app, as the node app then looked for everything in the "public" folder, and we didn't realize that at first. We also had to learn new Phaser features like the timer and tilemaps.

## Goals for next week
1. Set up other sprites & check for collisions with those sprites
2. Set up the question feature
3. Integrate the tilemap
4. Add ability to store high scores on the backend
